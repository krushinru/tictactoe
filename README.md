## Infinite Tic-Tac-Toe

Infinite Tic-Tac-Toe is a unique twist on the classic tic-tac-toe game. In this version, each player can only have three marks (either X or O) on the board at any given time. When a player places a fourth mark, their first mark disappears, adding a new layer of strategy to the game.
